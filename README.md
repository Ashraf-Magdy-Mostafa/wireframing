# 🧩 Wireframing

## 📌 What is Wireframing?

Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process, serving as a **blueprint or skeletal framework** of a website or application. It outlines the **basic structure and layout** without delving into detailed design elements like colors, fonts, or images. Wireframes focus on the **placement of elements**, **navigation flow**, and **overall user interface structure**.
